Support for the `multipart` property and `multipart/x-mixed-replace` responses, [deprecated since Firefox 20](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2012/xhr-multipart-support-is-now-deprecated/), has been removed from [`XMLHttpRequest`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest). This was a Firefox-only feature that was never standardized. [Server-Sent Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Server-sent_events), [Web Sockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/WebSockets) or inspecting `responseText` from progress events can be used instead.
