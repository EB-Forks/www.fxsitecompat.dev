As part of the ongoing effort to standardize global objects, the non-standard stylesheet change event interfaces, including `StyleRuleChangeEvent`, `StyleSheetApplicableStateChangeEvent` and `StyleSheetChangeEvent`, are no longer available from Web content. The `CSSGroupRuleRuleList` interface, the implementation detail of [`CSSRuleList`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/CSSRuleList), has also been removed.
