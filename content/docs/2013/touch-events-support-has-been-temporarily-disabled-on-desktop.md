      title: "Bug 888304 â€“ Content touch-events on Firefox-desktop should be disabled until we can support them properly"
---
The [touch events](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Events/Touch_events) support [introduced with Firefox 18](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2012/moztouch-events-were-removed-in-favour-of-the-standard-touch-events/) has been disabled on the **desktop** version of Firefox, as some popular sites including *Google* and *Twitter* are not working properly. Once the bug is fixed, the API will be enabled again. To enable it anyway, open `about:config` and set the `dom.w3c_touch_events.enabled` pref to `2`. The mobile versions including [Firefox for Android](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_for_Android) and [Firefox OS](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS) are not affected by this change. Also, the API has been enabled on the Metro-style version of Firefox for Windows 8.
