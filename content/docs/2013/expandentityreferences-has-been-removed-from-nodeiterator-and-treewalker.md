The [`expandEntityReferences`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/NodeIterator.expandEntityReferences) property, which returned a flag indicating whether or not the children of entity reference nodes were visible to the object, has been removed from the [`NodeIterator`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/NodeIterator) and [`TreeWalker`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/TreeWalker) objects, as it never made much sense.
