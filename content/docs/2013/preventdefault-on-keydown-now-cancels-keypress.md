      title: "Bug 501496 â€“ preventDefault on keydown does not cancel following keypress"
---
Previously, calling the [`preventDefault`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/event.preventDefault) method on a [`keydown`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Events/keydown) event didn't cancel the following [`keypress`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Events/keypress) event. It has been fixed to match the DOM Level 3 Events (D3E) spec as well as the behaviour of other browsers.
