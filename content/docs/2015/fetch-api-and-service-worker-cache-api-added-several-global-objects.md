Starting with Firefox 39, the new [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) has been enabled by default. This API has implemented the [`Headers`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Headers), [`Request`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Request), [`Response`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Response) interfaces as well as the [`fetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/GlobalFetch/fetch) method, so that you can no longer use those names for your global variables. *Dailymotion* is known to be affected by this change, because the site had its own `Request` object.

Firefox 39 has also implemented and enabled the [Service Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorker_API) Cache API on the Aurora and Nightly channels, so you may have to be careful with the new [`Cache`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Cache) and [`CacheStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/CacheStorage) interfaces as well.
