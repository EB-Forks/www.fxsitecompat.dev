The support for the `hspace` and `vspace` attributes on the [`<table>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table) element will be removed in the near future. In Firefox, those attributes are usable only in the [Quirks mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla_Quirks_Mode_Behavior).
