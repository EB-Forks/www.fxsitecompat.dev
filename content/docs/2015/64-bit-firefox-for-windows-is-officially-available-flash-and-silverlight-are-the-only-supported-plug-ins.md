Firefox 64-bit builds for Windows have been available for testing as [Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/developer/all/) and [Beta](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/beta/all/) for a while, and starting with Firefox 42, the 64-bit builds are available to the public via the [Release](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/all/) (stable) channel. This means a lot more users will start using the 64-bit version, and if your content requires a 32-bit [NPAPI plug-in](https://developer.mozilla.org/Add-ons/Plugins), it won't work for those Firefox users. Currently Adobe Flash Player is the only supported plug-in on the 64-bit builds. Content publishers are strongly encouraged to move away from plug-in dependencies in favour of the [latest Web technologies](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web).

**Update**: The public release of Windows 64-bit builds has been postponed while Mozilla is "waiting for some partner changes". The current timeline is unknown.

**Update**: Mozilla has decided to ship the 64-bit version with Firefox 43, enabling the Silverlight support as well.

**Update**: There is a [bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1236911) on 64-bit builds where the file picker cannot be opened from Flash content. Mozilla is working with Adobe to solve the issue.
