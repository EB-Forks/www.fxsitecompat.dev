The third and final phase of [phasing out 1024-bit root certificates](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2014/09/08/phasing-out-certificates-with-1024-bit-rsa-keys/) has completed with Firefox 38. As the blog post describes, if your SSL certificate has a 1024-bit key or was issued by a CA with a 1024-bit key, you have to get a new SSL certificate and update it on your Web server.

**Update**: *Equifax Secure Certificate Authority* 1024-bit root has been [temporarily re-enabled](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1155279) due to considerable breakages.
