Firefox now shows a [broken padlock icon](https://bug1179961.bmoattachments.org/attachment.cgi?id=8662392) on the Address Bar when the current page has `<input type="password">` while the connection is not secure. Not only the page the password will be sent but also the page the login form presents must use the HTTPS protocol to [protect user credentials from remote attackers](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Security/Insecure_passwords).

Although this functionality is currently enabled only on Firefox Nightly and Developer Edition, webmasters may want to avoid such an embarrassing situation. No budget for a TLS certificate? Don't worry. From November 2015, [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), a new certificate authority run by Mozilla and others, gives you a trusted certificate for free.

Read [Tanvi Vyas' blog post](https://blog.mozilla.org/tanvi/2016/01/28/no-more-passwords-over-http-please/) for details.

**Update**: This feature has been enabled on the early Beta versions of Firefox 50 as well to collect more feedback from users.

**Update 2**: As of [Firefox 51](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2016/insecure-password-input-warning-will-be-enabled-by-default/), the warning is enabled by default on all channels including the Release version.
