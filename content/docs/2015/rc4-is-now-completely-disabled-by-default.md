Mozilla and other major browser vendors have agreed to stop supporting the insecure RC4 cipher suites, [deprecated since Firefox 36](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2014/rc4-support-has-been-deprecated/), in early <time datetime="2016">2016</time>.

As per the [deprecation plan](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/mozilla.dev.platform/JIEFcrGhqSM/discussion), Firefox 44 has disabled the [whitelist](https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/security/manager/ssl/IntolerantFallbackList.inc) that allowed certain sites to use RC4, therefore users will see the [Untrusted Connection](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/connection-untrusted-error-message) error message on any sites with RC4 enabled. Web servers must be upgraded as soon as possible to use stronger cipher suites.
