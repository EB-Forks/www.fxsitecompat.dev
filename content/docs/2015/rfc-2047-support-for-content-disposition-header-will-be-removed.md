Firefox tries to decode the `filename` parameter in the HTTP `Content-Disposition` header using the RFC 2047 encoding. This is a bug according to the spec, and implemented only by Firefox and Google Chrome. Therefore, The support for RFC 2047 is considered to be removed. This change was [originally planned for Firefox 22](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2013/rfc-2047-encoding-support-for-http-header-field-parameters-has-been-removed/), but has been postponed due to interoperability issues. The RFC 2231 and 5987 encodings should be used instead.
