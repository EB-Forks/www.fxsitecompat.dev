The deprecated, non-standard [`window.sidebar`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/window.sidebar) object will be removed in the near future. The `addPanel` method has been [removed with Firefox 23](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2013/ability-to-add-a-sidebar-panel-has-been-dropped/), and `addSearchEngine` method has [dropped the Sherlock support with Firefox 44](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2015/sherlock-search-plug-ins-are-no-longer-supported/), so this object is no longer useful. However, apparently it's still used by some sites for browser detection. Web developers should stop using it.

**Update**: The `addSearchEngine` method has been [removed with Firefox 59](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2018/window-sidebar-addsearchengine-has-been-removed/).

**Update 2**: `window.sidebar` is no longer available on the Nightly channel as of [Firefox 65](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2018/window-sidebar-and-window-external-addsearchprovider-have-been-deprecated/).
