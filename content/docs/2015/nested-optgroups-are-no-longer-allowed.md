According to the HTML5 spec, nested [`<optgroup>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/optgroup) elements are not valid. Firefox now obeys the spec, so an [`<option>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/option) element put under programmatically nested `<optgroup>` elements is no longer a member of the topmost [`<select>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select) element. That means the `<option>` cannot be selected and it won't appear in the `options` DOM property of the `<select>`.
