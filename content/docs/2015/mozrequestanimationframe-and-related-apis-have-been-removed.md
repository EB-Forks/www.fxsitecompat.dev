The `mozRequestAnimationFrame`, `mozCancelAnimationFrame` and `mozCancelRequestAnimationFrame` methods, [deprecated since Firefox 23](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2013/requestanimationframe-and-cancelanimationframe-have-been-unprefixed/), have been removed in favour of the standard [`requestAnimationFrame`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Window/requestAnimationFrame) and [`cancelAnimationFrame`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Window/cancelAnimationFrame) methods. The [`mozAnimationStartTime`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Window/mozAnimationStartTime) property has also been removed but the compatibility impact should be minimum since no other browsers implement the equivalent.
