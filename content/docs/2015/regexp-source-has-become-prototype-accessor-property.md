The `source` property on the [`RegExp`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp) instance has been moved to the prototype accessors, so it's now the [`RegExp.prototype.source`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/source) property. This change was originally made to Firefox 38 [along with other properties](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2015/regexp-global-ignorecase-multiline-and-sticky-properties-are-now-prototype-accessor-properties/) but has been backed out due to Web compatibility issues. If you are using [*ClojureScript*](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript), you have to update the library to the latest version or your app may be broken on Firefox 41 and later.
