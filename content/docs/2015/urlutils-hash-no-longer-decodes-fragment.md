The [`URLUtils.hash`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/URLUtils/hash) property, which is available as `location.hash`, `HTMLAnchorElement.hash`, `URL.hash`, etc., now returns a percent-encoded fragment as we see in the [`href`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/URLUtils/href) property, to follow the latest specification. So, for instance, a space will be `%20`, and you have to use the [`decodeURIComponent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/decodeURIComponent) method to get the decoded fragment ([example](https://github.com/mozilla/phonebook/commit/78619461421f1619d32d89b4eaca0c0fb49ef164)). This change was originally planned for Firefox 38 but has been postponed due to compatibility issues. This new behaviour matches the current version of Safari.
