Starting with version 43, the [`event.timeStamp`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/event.timeStamp) property returns a [`DOMHighResTimeStamp`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/DOMHighResTimeStamp) in microseconds, instead of a traditional time stamp in milliseconds, on the Nightly and Aurora ([Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/channel/#developer)) channels for Linux. This feature has been implemented on Windows since [Firefox 33](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2014/event-timestamp-now-returns-domhighrestimestamp-on-nightly-aurora-for-windows/), but still disabled on the Beta and Release channels, and not yet implemented on OS X.

**Update**: It has been reported that the animation functionality of *AngularJS* doesn't work properly when `DOMHighResTimeStamp` is enabled.
