Previously, the [`for...in`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in) and [`for...of`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of) statements could have an initializer in the loop head declaration, like `for (var/let/const x = ... in/of ...)`. This syntax had incorrectly been permitted by ECMAScript 1 to 5 but has been removed from ECMAScript 6. Firefox now ignores such initializers, so `for (var i = 0 in array)`, for example, will be parsed as `for (var i in array)`.
