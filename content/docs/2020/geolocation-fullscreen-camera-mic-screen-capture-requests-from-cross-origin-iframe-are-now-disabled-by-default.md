Firefox 74 has added the support for [Feature Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Feature_Policy) that allows web developers to control the behaviour of various web platform features and APIs. The new `allow` attribute on the `<iframe>` element can be used to control features within the `<iframe>`, where certain features are now disabled for third parties by default in an effort to avoid confusion for users.

These features can no longer be used in cross-origin `<iframe>`s unless the feature is explicitly enabled with the `allow` attribute:

* Geolocation API: [`geolocation`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Feature-Policy/geolocation) directive
* Fullscreen API: [`fullscreen`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Feature-Policy/fullscreen) directive
* Camera and mic access: [`camera`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Feature-Policy/camera) and [`microphone`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Feature-Policy/microphone) directives
* Screen Capture API: [`display-capture`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Feature-Policy/display-capture) directive

So, for example, if you'd like to allow a third-party `<iframe>` to use the Geolocation API, you have to write something like this, otherwise their permission request will be silently blocked:

```html
<iframe src="https://maps.example.com/" allow="geolocation"></iframe>
```

These features can no longer be used in cross-origin `<iframe>`s even if you use the `allow` attribute:

* Persistent storage via `navigator.storage.persist()`
* Notifications API (since [Firefox 70](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2019/notification-permission-requests-from-cross-origin-iframe-are-now-disallowed/))
* Vibration API (since [Firefox 72](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2019/vibration-api-can-no-longer-be-used-from-cross-origin-iframe/))

**Update**: The change has been postponed from Firefox 73 to 74.

**Update 2**: *Google Hangouts* is affected by this change, where mic access from *Gmail* doesn’t work. Also, video players’ fullscreen button is not working on *AOL*-owned web properties including *HuffPost*, *Engadget* and *TechCrunch*.
