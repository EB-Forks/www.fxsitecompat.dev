Firefox 74 has removed the support for creating several non-standard events with [`document.createEvent()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Document/createEvent). These event types include:

* `KeyEvents` (standard equivalent: `KeyboardEvent`)
* `MouseScrollEvents`
* `ScrollAreaEvent`
* `TimeEvent`

**Update**: One minor website is affected by this change.
