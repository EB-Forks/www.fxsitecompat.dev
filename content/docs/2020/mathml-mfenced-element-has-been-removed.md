The MathML [`<mfenced>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/MathML/Element/mfenced) element deprecated since [Firefox 71](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2019/various-legacy-mathml-features-have-been-deprecated/) has been removed with Firefox 73. Use the [`<mrow>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/MathML/Element/mrow) and [`<mo>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/MathML/Element/mo) elements instead.
