The [`removestream`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Events/removestream) event and the corresponding [`onremovestream`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/onremovestream) event handler property on the `RTCPeerConnection` interface have been removed with Firefox 60, because these are no longer in the WebRTC spec. The `removetrack` event and the corresponding [`onremovetrack`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/MediaStream/onremovetrack) event handler on `MediaStream` should be used instead.
