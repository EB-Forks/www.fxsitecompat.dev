Firefox 61 has removed the `viewTarget` property from the [`SVGViewElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/SVGViewElement) interface. It was defined in the SVG 1.1 spec but removed with SVG 2 due to lack of use. Also, Firefox didn't have the proper implementation, rather returning an error.

Given that [Google Chrome 56](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5665473114931200) shipped in January 2017 has already made the change, the compatibility risk should be low.
