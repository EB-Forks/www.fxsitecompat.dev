The support for the [`xml:base`](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlbase/) attribute, deprecated since [Firefox 53](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2017/xml-base-attribute-has-been-deprecated/), has been removed with Firefox 66. The feature similar to the HTML [`<base>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/base) element was removed from the spec years ago and no other browsers support it at this time, so the risk of the removal should be very low.
