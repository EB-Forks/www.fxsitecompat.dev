Firefox 65 has re-added the support for the Internet Explorer-derived [`window.event`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Window/event) and [`Event.prototype.returnValue`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Event/returnValue) properties, which was once landed on [Firefox 63](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2018/support-for-event-returnvalue-has-been-added/) but soon disabled on non-Nightly channels due to several site compatibility issues.

In Firefox 65 and later, when the `keyCode` property of the `keypress` event is `0`, the value will be the same as `charCode`. Conversely, when `charCode` is `0`, it will be the same as `keyCode`. Although this mirroring behaviour matches other browsers and is expected to solve most of the compatibility issues, user agent sniffing might cause another issues like the *Closure Library*, which has already been [solved by Google](https://github.com/google/closure-library/issues/932).

Web developers are also discouraged to use these once-non-standard properties for browser detection.

**Update**: This change has been [postponed to Firefox 66](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1520756) to deal with an [input issue](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1514940) in *Confluence*'s comment editor.
