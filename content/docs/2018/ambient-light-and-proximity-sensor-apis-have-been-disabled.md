The support for the [Ambient Light Sensor](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Ambient_Light_Events) and [Proximity Sensor](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Proximity_Events) APIs, the [`devicelight`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Events/devicelight), [`deviceproximity`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Events/deviceproximity) and [`userproximity`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Events/userproximity) events in particular, have been disabled by default with Firefox 62 due to concerns over user privacy and [same-origin policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy) violations.

Those APIs have already been disabled in the Nightly and early Beta/DevEdition channels since the [version 60](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2018/various-device-sensor-apis-are-now-deprecated/), and no issues have been reported so far. Given that the browser support is very limited at this time, the compatibility impact should be minimal.
