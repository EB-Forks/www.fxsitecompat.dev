The [`@-moz-document`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/@document) rule is no longer available from Web content since it could be used by attackers for CSS injection to steal private data in the URL of third-party sites. Firefox users are still able to use this rule in the user stylesheet to personalize their browsing experience.

The at-rule support has already been removed from Nightly and early Beta/DevEdition as of Firefox 59, and removed from all the channels with Firefox 61.

An exception is the empty `url-prefix` function that has been used as a [CSS hack targeting Firefox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/css-hacks-targeting-firefox/). It continues to be parsed on the Release channel to avoid breakages but will be removed in the near future once major compatibility issues are solved.

```css
/* This only works with Firefox */
@-moz-document url-prefix() {
  #prices td {
    height: 100%;
  }
}
```

**Update**: Mozilla developers have decided not to disable the hack because itâ€™s still used on various major sites.
