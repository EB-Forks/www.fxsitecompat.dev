Previously, the initial value for the [`justify-items`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/justify-items) CSS property was `auto`. After a [discussion](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/1318) in the CSS Working Group, it has been renamed to `legacy`. Firefox 61 makes this change as per the latest Box Alignment spec, making `auto` an invalid value with no transition period. Use `legacy` instead from now on.
