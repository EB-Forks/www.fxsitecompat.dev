The `min-content` and `max-content` keywords that can be used for CSS sizing properties such as `width`, `height` and `flex-basis` are now available unprefixed in Firefox 66 and later. Google Chrome has supported the unprefixed keywords since the version 46.

The removal of the prefixed version, `-moz-min-content` and `-moz-max-content`, which will remain supported as the aliases, is yet to be announced.
