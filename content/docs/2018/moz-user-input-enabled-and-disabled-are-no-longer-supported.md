Firefox 60 has removed the support for the `enabled` and `disabled` values of the non-standard [`-moz-user-input`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/-moz-user-input) CSS property because the usage is very low, and those were actually broken when changed dynamically. While `none` and the default `auto` value are still supported, the property itself may also be entirely removed in the future. Given that no other browsers support this property, the compatibility risk should be low.
