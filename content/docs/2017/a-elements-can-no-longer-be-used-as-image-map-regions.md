In HTML 4, [`<a>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a) elements could be used as the hotspot regions on a [`<map>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/map), like [`<area>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/area) elements, in combination with the `coords` and `shape` attributes. Firefox 58 has dropped the support for this functionality because it was implemented by no other browsers and also removed from the HTML 5 spec.
