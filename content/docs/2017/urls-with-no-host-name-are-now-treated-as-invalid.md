Firefox 54 and later will treat URLs without any host name, such as `http:`, `http://`, `ftp:` and `ftp://`, as invalid URLs where they're supposed to be. That means the following JavaScript code will now throw a `TypeError`:

```js
new URL('http://')
```

Also, HTML forms containing a URL-type input control like this will not be validated unless the value is changed manually or dynamically:

```html
<input type="url" value="http://">
```

In this case, you can replace the `value` attribute with the `placeholder` attribute to work around the issue.

**Update**: This change is affecting *EarthLink Web Mail* where the customers have difficulty in sending messages.
