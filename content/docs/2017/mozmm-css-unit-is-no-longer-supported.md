The non-standard, experimental `mozmm` [CSS length unit](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/length), that represents exact one millimeter regardless of the display resolution, has been removed with Firefox 59 as it won't be part of the spec. Some developer discussions can be found in the intent thread below.
