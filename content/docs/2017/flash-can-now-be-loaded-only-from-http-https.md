Firefox 55 and later will prevent Flash content from being loaded from `file`, `ftp` or any other URL schemes except `http` and `https`. This change aims to improve security, because a different [same-origin policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy) is applied to the `file` protocol, and loading Flash content from other minor protocols is usually not well-tested.

Developers can still test local Flash files by flipping the hidden `plugins.http_https_only` preference through [`about:config`](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/about-config-editor-firefox), but you may rather want to set up a local web server by using [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/) for example.
