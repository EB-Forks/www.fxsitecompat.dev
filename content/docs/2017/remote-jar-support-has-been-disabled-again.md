For security reasons, Java archive (JAR) files can no longer be loaded from remote locations by default. This change was originally made with [Firefox 45](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2015/jar-protocol-support-has-been-disabled-by-default/) but soon reverted because *IBM iNotes* was broken. The product was then [updated in May 2016](https://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/fixlist.nsf/8d1c0550e6242b69852570c900549a74/e413ea1ca447b3bf85257f77006b7f60) to not use JAR for Firefox, hence the re-attempt with Firefox 55.

*iNotes* customers must install the Fix Pack to solve the compatibility issue. If the instance cannot be updated now for some reason, use Firefox 52 [Extended Support Release](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/organizations/) so the remote JAR support is available until <del>Q2</del> <ins>August</ins> 2018.

No other browsers support JAR. No other broken apps are reported so far.

**Update** The remote JAR support has been [completely removed with Firefox 61](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2018/remote-jar-support-has-been-completely-removed/).
