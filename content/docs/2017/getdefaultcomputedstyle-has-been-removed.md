The non-standard [`window.getDefaultComputedStyle`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Window/getDefaultComputedStyle) method, that returns the browser's default computed values on an element, has been removed with Firefox 55. Unlike the similar [`getComputedStyle`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Window/getComputedStyle) method, it has never been standardized as part of the CSSOM spec nor implemented in other browsers.

It's known to be used in jQuery, but the removal should not be a problem thanks to proper feature detection and fallback. No other use cases have been identified.

**Update**: Due to a [compatibility issue](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=548397) affecting the older versions of jQuery, where `getComputedStyle` returns `null` inside invisible iframes, this change has been backed out from Firefox 55. However, the `getDefaultComputedStyle` method will be removed anyway in the future.
