On Firefox 51 and later, according to the current HTML spec, the `<img>` element fires an [`error`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Events/error) event when the `src` attribute was empty. The event will also be fired when the `src` DOM property is dynamically changed to an empty value or `null`.

**Update**: *Bing Maps* is currently broken due to this change.
