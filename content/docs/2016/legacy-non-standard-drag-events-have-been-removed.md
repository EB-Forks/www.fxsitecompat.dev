The support for the non-standard drag-related events that had been left for backward compatibility has been removed with Firefox 50. The `draggesture` and `dragdrop` events should be replaced with the standard [`dragstart`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Events/dragstart) and [`drop`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Events/drop) events respectively. Meanwhile, the [`dragexit`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Events/dragexit) event has been standardized so you don't have to care about it anymore.

**Update**: This change seems to be affecting several sites including *NFL.com* and *TweetDeck*.
