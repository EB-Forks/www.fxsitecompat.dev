The non-standard `navigator.mozApps` [Open Web Apps JavaScript API](https://developer.mozilla.org/Apps/Build/JavaScript_API) and [Web App Runtime](https://developer.mozilla.org/Apps/Build/Architecture), that allowed Web applications to be installed and run on the user's device like native applications, have been removed from Firefox 47 for [desktop](https://developer.mozilla.org/Marketplace/Options/Open_web_apps_for_desktop) and [Android](https://developer.mozilla.org/Marketplace/Options/Open_web_apps_for_android).

Those functionalities were invented by Mozilla Labs in 2011 then became an integral part of [Firefox OS](https://developer.mozilla.org/Apps/Build/Building_apps_for_Firefox_OS) built on modern Web technologies. However, the runtime has not been widely used and actively developed on other platforms.

The [Firefox Marketplace](https://developer.mozilla.org/Marketplace) will stop distributing apps to desktop computers and Android devices accordingly. Firefox OS is not affected at this moment. Open Web Apps are not supported on WebKit-based Firefox for iOS.
