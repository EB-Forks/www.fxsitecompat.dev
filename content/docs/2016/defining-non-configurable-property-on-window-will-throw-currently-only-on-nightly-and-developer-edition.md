Firefox 42 and later will throw a [`TypeError`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypeError) when you attempt to define a non-configurable property on [`window`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Window) with the [`Object.defineProperty`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineProperty) or [`Object.defineProperties`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineProperties) method. For now, this change has been made to Firefox Nightly and Developer Edition only. A couple of site compatibility issues have been found, and Mozilla developers are discussing the next step accordingly.
