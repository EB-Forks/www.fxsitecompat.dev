As part of the HTML5 standard compliance, Firefox 45 has changed the way how to internally load a [Web worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API) script. There are 2 backward compatiblity issues you should know.

Previously, Firefox was throwing a `SecurityError` immediately when attempting to load a cross-origin worker script with the [`Worker`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Worker/Worker) constructor. On Firefox 45 and later, a generic `error` event will be asynchronously fired once a new `Worker` instance is created, according to the latest spec. In order to deal with both cases, you have to use the worker's [`onerror`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/AbstractWorker/onerror) handler along with a [`try-catch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/try...catch) statement:

```js
try {
  var worker = new Worker(url);
  worker.addEventListener('error', function (event) {
    // Error: Failed to load script (nsresult = 0x805303f4)
    // Prevent the event from bubbling
    event.preventDefault();
    // Handle the cross-origin load error for newer browsers
    ...
  });
} catch (ex) {
  // SecurityError
  // Handle the cross-origin load error for older browsers
  ...
}
```
Mozilla's [*PDF.js*](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/) library is currently broken in cross-origin environments such as CDNs because it lacks the `onerror` handler for the worker and the fallback function will never get called.

**Update**: *PDF.js* version 1.4.187 has fixed the issue. You can download the latest pre-built version from the [pdfjs-dist repository](https://github.com/mozilla/pdfjs-dist) until a new release is available on the [pdf.js repository](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/releases). You can also build it yourself.

Firefox 45 has also solved an implementation bug where the browser was incorrectly allowing a worker to be loaded in an [`<iframe>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe) with the `sandbox` attribute. Such code now leads to an error as above, because the document in a sandboxed iframe has a unique origin that won't match anything, while worker scripts are required to be [same-origin](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy). The workaround here is adding `allow-same-origin` to the `sandbox` value, though it's not recommended due to the loosened protection.
