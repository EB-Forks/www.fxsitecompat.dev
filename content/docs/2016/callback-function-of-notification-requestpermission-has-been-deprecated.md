The support for the [`Notification.requestPermission`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Notification/requestPermission) method has been updated for the latest Notifications API spec. The method now returns a `Promise` that resolves to a permission value, and the optional callback function is considered deprecated.
