Starting with Firefox 44, the [`mouseover`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Events/mouseover), [`mouseout`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Events/mouseout), [`mouseenter`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Events/mouseenter) and [`mouseleave`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Events/mouseleave) events will be fired for disabled form controls such as [`<input>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input). The old behaviour had sometimes confused Web developers using jQuery in particular.

In order to make sure your code always works as expected, you might want to explicitly check the `disabled` property of the target element in your event handler.
