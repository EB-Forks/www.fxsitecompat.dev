As of Firefox 52, the [Battery Status API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Battery_Status_API) is no longer available from Web content for privacy reasons, where it could be used by remote trackers for user fingerprinting. It's unknown if there were legitimate use cases of the API.

**Update**: It turned out that Firefox 52 removed the `navigator.getBattery` method but didn't remove the `BatteryManager` interface. The latter has been removed with Firefox 72.
