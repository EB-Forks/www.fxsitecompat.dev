The [`navigator.battery`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Navigator/battery) property, [deprecated since Firefox 43](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2015/navigator-battery-has-been-deprecated-in-favour-of-async-getbattery-method/), has been removed with Firefox 50. Instead, use the standardized [`navigator.getBattery`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Navigator/getBattery) method that returns a `Promise` resolved in a [`BatteryManager`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/BatteryManager) instance.

**Update**: The Battery Status API has been [removed with Firefox 52](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2016/battery-status-api-has-been-removed/).
