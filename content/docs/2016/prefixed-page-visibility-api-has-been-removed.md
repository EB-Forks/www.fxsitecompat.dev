The support for the prefixed [Page Visibility API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Page_Visibility_API), [deprecated since Firefox 18](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2012/page-visibility-api-has-been-unprefixed/), has been removed with Firefox 51. This includes the `mozHidden` and `mozVisibilityState` properties as well as the `mozvisibilitychange` event. Use the unprefixed, standard equivalents instead.
