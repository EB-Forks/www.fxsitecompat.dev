The [`Permissions.revoke`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Permissions/revoke) method on the [Permissions API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Permissions_API) is now disabled by default because it has been shipped prematurely with Firefox 47 while the spec is not stable yet at this moment. It will eventually be re-enabled or removed depending on the progress of the standardization work.
