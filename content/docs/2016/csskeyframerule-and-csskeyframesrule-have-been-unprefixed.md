The prefixed `MozCSSKeyframeRule` and `MozCSSKeyframesRule` interfaces have been replaced with the standard [`CSSKeyframeRule`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/CSSKeyframeRule) and [`CSSKeyframesRule`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/CSSKeyframesRule) interfaces respectively. The prefixed ones are no longer available in Firefox 48 and later.
