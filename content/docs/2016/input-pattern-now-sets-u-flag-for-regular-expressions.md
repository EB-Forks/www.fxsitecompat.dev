The `pattern` attribute on the [`<input>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) element, introduced with HTML5, is used to check the entered value against the author-defined regular expression. Starting with Firefox 46, the new `u` flag, introduced with ECMAScript 2015 (ES6), is set for the expression according to the latest HTML spec, treating it as a sequence of Unicode code points. Therefore, an unnecessary or invalid escape in the pattern such as `[\@\%]` will raise a `SyntaxError` saying "invalid identity escape in regular expression" and the validation will fail.
