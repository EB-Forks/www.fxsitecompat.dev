Mozilla has discovered various "technical and management failures" of certificate authorities (CA) called *WoSign* and *StartCom* based on a careful investigation, and decided to distrust their new certificates issued after October 21, 2016. Their older certificates remain accepted to avoid the impact on the existing customers, however, the affected root certificates will be removed from Firefox in the future. See [this Security Blog post](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2016/10/24/distrusting-new-wosign-and-startcom-certificates/) for details of the incident and Mozilla's action.
