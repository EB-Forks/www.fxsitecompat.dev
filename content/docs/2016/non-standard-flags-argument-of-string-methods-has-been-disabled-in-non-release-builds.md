      title: "Bug 1245801 - Disable non-standard flag argument of String.prototype.{search,match,replace} in non-release build."
---
The non-standard `flags` argument of the [`String.prototype.search`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/search), [`match`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/match) and [`replace`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace) methods, [deprecated since Firefox 39](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2015/non-standard-flags-argument-of-string-methods-has-been-deprecated/), is now disabled in Firefox Nightly and Developer Edition. Do not use the argument anymore; it will be completely [removed in the near future](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2015/non-standard-flags-argument-will-be-removed-from-string-search-methods/).

**Update**: The `flags` argument has been removed completely with Firefox 49.
