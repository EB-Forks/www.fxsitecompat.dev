The [`<label>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label) element is no longer associated with any `<form>` according to the latest HTML spec. The support for the `form` attribute on `<label>`, introduced with HTML5, has been removed with Firefox 49 accordingly.

The `form` property on [`HTMLLabelElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/HTMLLabelElement) DOM instances will instead return the labelled control's `form` property if any, and `null` otherwise. In other words, `label.form` will be an alias of `label.control.form`.
