The `disableRightClick`, [`popChallengeResponse`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript_crypto/popChallengeResponse) and `random` methods have been removed from [`window.crypto`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/window/crypto). Those were part of the non-standard [Crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/JavaScript_crypto) of Netscape 4 but not implemented in [Gecko](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Gecko)-based Netscape 6 and Firefox, just throwing a `NS_ERROR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED` exception. Note that the standardized [`window.crypto.getRandomValues`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/window/crypto/getRandomValues) method is available since [Firefox 21](https://developer.mozilla.org/Firefox/Releases/21) to get cryptographically random values.
