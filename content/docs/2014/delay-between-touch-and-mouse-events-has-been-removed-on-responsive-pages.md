      title: "Bug 941995 â€“ Remove 300ms touch > mouse events delay for double-tap zoom on \"responsive\" pages"
---
Both [Firefox for Android](https://developer.mozilla.org/Firefox_for_Android) and [Firefox OS](https://developer.mozilla.org/Firefox_OS) support double-tap-to-zoom, and there is a 300-millisecond delay between the touch event ([`touchend`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Reference/Events/touchend)) and the mouse event ([`click`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Reference/Events/click)) to detect and enable this gesture. In order to improve the responsiveness of applications, this delay has been removed on non-zoomable, [responsive designed](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web_Development/Mobile/Responsive_design) pages that specify `width=device-width` (or some value less than `device-width`) and/or `user-scalable=no` in the [viewport `<meta>` tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Mobile/Viewport_meta_tag). Google Chrome 32 also removed the delay. Read an [article on HTML5 Rocks](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2013/12/300ms-tap-delay-gone-away) for details.
