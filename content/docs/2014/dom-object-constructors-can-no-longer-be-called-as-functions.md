Previously, [WebIDL](https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/webidl/) constructors could be called without the [`new`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/new) operator. Starting with Firefox 30, such code will raise a [`TypeError`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypeError) like Chrome and Safari. For example, `var req = XMLHttpRequest();` should be `var req = new XMLHttpRequest();`.
