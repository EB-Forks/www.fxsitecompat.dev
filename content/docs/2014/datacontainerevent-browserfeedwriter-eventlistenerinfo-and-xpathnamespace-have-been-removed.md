As part of the ongoing effort to standardize global objects, some interfaces have been removed from [`window`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/window). The standard [`CustomEvent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/CustomEvent) interface should be used instead the Firefox-specific `DataContainerEvent` interface. `BrowserFeedWriter` was a Firefox-specific interface which should not be exposed to Web content. `EventListenerInfo` was also a non-standard interface which was not intended to be a global object. The `XPathNamespace` interface was part of the DOM3 XPath spec but has not been implemented.
