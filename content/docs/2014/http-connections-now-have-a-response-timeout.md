      title: "Bug 947391 â€“ HTTP connections (exc. XHR, SPDY) should have a response timeout"
---
Firefox has enabled a timeout to drop HTTP connections, except XMLHttpRequest and SPDY sessions, if the response takes too long. The initial value is 300 seconds or 5 minutes. If your application is processing large data and affected by this change, you can change the value of the `network.http.response.timeout` preference to a larger number via [about:config](http://kb.mozillazine.org/About:config).
