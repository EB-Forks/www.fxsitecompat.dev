      title: "Bug 886308 â€“ Implement Element.matches()"
---
The [`Element.matches`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Element.matches) method has finally been unprefixed since the spec is now considered stable. The prefixed `mozMatchesSelector` method will be [removed in the future](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2015/element-mozmatchesselector-will-be-removed/).
