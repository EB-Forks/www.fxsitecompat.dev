The support for SSL certificates using the [weak SHA-1 hash algorithm](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Security/Weak_Signature_Algorithm) has been deprecated. The [Web Console will log a warning](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools/Web_Console#Security_warnings_and_errors) when a SHA-1 certificate is found.

**Update** The SHA-1 support will be [disabled in January 2017](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2016/sha-1-certificates-issued-by-public-ca-will-no-longer-be-accepted/).
