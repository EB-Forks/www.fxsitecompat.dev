The `DOM_VK_ENTER` constant has been removed from the [`KeyboardEvent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent) interface and it now returns `null` instead of `14`. This should not break any existing code since it has never used in key events like [`keydown`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Events/keydown) or [`keypress`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Events/keypress), but you may want to remove it if you have. The `DOM_VK_RETURN` constant represents both <kbd>Enter</kbd> and <kbd>Return</kbd> keys.
