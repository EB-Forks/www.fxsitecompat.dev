---
Previously, pointer event handlers, including `onpointerup`, `onpointerover`, `onpointerout`, `onpointermove`, `onpointerleave`, `onpointerenter`, `onpointerdown` and `onpointercancel`, were accidentally exposed on the global object even when the [Pointer Events API](https://www.w3.org/TR/pointerevents/) was disabled. The API has not yet been enabled by default. This bug was affecting *Google Play* where a feature detection using `onpointerup` was working but the event itself was never fired. These properties are no longer exposed when the API is disabled.
