The non-standard, Netscape-derived [`window.home`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/window/home), [`window.back`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/window/back) and [`window.forward`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/window/forward) methods have been removed. The standard [`history.back`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/history/back) and [`history.forward`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/history/forward) methods can be used instead to [manipulate the browser history](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history).
