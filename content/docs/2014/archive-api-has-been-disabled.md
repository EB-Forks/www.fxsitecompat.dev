The [Archive API](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/10/archiveapi-read-out-archive-file-contents-introducing-bleeding-edge/), experimentally implemented since Firefox 17 as [`ArchiveReader`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/ArchiveReader) and [`ArchiveRequest`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/ArchiveRequest), has been disabled behind a preference. If you'd like to test the API, change the value of `dom.archivereader.enabled` to `true`.
