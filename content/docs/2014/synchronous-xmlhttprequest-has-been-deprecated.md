      title: "Bug 969671 â€“ Warn about use of sync XHR in the main thread"
---
The `async` argument of the [`XMLHttpRequest.open`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/open) method is `true` by default, and `false` makes the request synchronous. Developers now get an warning in the [Web Console](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools/Web_Console) if a [synchronous request](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/Synchronous_and_Asynchronous_Requests#Synchronous_request) is used on the main thread, or the outside of [workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Guide/Performance/Using_web_workers), since it's now considered deprecated due to the negative effects to the user experience.

Possible solutions: using synchronous requests in a [`Worker`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Worker), or using asynchronous requests in a [`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise).
