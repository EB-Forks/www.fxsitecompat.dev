Firefox 69 has removed the now-non-standard `DOMError` interface, which had been deprecated since [Firefox 58](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2017/domerror-has-been-replaced-with-domexception/) when all the instances were replaced with `DOMException`. The current usage is nearly zero according to Mozilla's Telemetry, so the compatibility risk of the removal should be low.
