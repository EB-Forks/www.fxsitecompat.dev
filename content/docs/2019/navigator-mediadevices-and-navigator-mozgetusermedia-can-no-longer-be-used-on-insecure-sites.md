Starting with Firefox 69, the `navigator.mediaDevices` object and the non-standard `navigator.mozGetUserMedia` method are only available to websites served via HTTPS. Calling the `getUserMedia`, `enumerateDevices` or any other method on the `navigator.mediaDevices` object on an insecure site will throw a `TypeError` exception because the object doesn't exist. Google Chrome has already made the same change in version 74.

Note that the `getUserMedia` method has already been available only to secure sites in [Firefox 68](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2019/getusermedia-can-no-longer-be-used-on-insecure-sites/). Meanwhile, these methods will continue to be available to `http://localhost` which is considered as a secure origin, so web developers can test camera and microphone features in a local environment. The production site, however, has to be served via HTTPS at any time.
