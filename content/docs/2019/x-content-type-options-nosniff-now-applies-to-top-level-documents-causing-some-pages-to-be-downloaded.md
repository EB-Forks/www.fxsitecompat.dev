The [`X-Content-Type-Options`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Content-Type-Options) HTTP response header has been supported since Firefox 50, and the `nosniff` directive can be used to effectively block scripts and stylesheets served with a wrong MIME type.

Starting with Firefox 71, it will be applied to top-level documents as well, aiming at further improving the browser security. It means HTML web pages served with a MIME type other than `text/html` will be downloaded instead of being rendered when the `X-Content-Type-Options` header is utilized.

There are a couple of sites known to be affected by this change, including *Microsoft Office 365*, so make sure to double check your site.

**Update**: The change has been backed out from Firefox 71. Mozilla developers are planning to redo this in Firefox 72 with some tweaks.

**Update 2**: The change has been landed again to Firefox 72. To mitigate the compatibility risk, the MIME type sniffing will be enabled when `X-Content-Type-Options` is set but no `Content-Type` is provided.

**Update 3**: The empty `Content-Type` workaround has been removed with [Firefox 75](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2020/x-content-type-options-nosniff-is-now-enforced-even-if-content-type-is-not-given/).
