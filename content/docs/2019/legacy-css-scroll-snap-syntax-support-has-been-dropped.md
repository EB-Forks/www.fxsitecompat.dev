Firefox 68 has implemented the [latest CSS Scroll Snap spec](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-scroll-snap-1/) that has been revised significantly since the [initial implementation](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/09/scroll-snapping-explained/) was shipped with Firefox 39. While Chrome and Safari have already added the support for the new syntax, the changes in Firefox are not backward-compatible:

* The `scroll-snap-coordinate`, `scroll-snap-destination`, `scroll-snap-type-x` and `scroll-snap-type-y` properties have been dropped
* The `scroll-snap-type` property has become a longhand, so the old shorthand syntax like `scroll-snap-type:mandatory` will stop working

Be sure to update your stylesheets accordingly for the new syntax if you have already utilized Scroll Snap.
