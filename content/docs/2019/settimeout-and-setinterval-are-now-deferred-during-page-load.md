Starting with Firefox 66, timers added with the `window.setTimeout` or `window.setInterval` method during page load will be given a low priority and deferred until an idle time is available or the loading is complete.

While this change aims at improving the performance of complex web applications like *Google Docs*, unexpected race conditions could occur if the initialization code is not designed properly. One regression on the *Best Buy*'s website has been reported and later fixed by themselves, which was likely due to a change in the resource access order, according to a Mozilla developer.

Remember that timers on the web are not so accurate. [It may take longer than specified](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setTimeout#Reasons_for_delays_longer_than_specified) for various reasons, such as when the browser tab is in background.

**Update**: [Firefox 68](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2019/xhr-load-loadend-events-are-now-deferred-during-page-load/) has made a similar change to XHR final events.

**Update 2**: [Firefox 69](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2019/resolving-promise-returned-by-fetch-is-now-deferred-during-page-load/) has made a similar change to `fetch()` as well.
