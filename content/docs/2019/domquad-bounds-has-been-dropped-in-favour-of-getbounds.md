The `bounds` property on the [`DOMQuad`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/DOMQuad) interface, deprecated since [Firefox 62](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2018/dompoint-constructor-no-longer-accepts-dompointinit-as-argument-domquad-bounds-has-been-deprecated/), has been removed with Firefox 69, as per the current Geometry Interfaces spec. Given that no other browsers support the property, the compatibility risk should be low. Use the standard `getBounds` method instead.
