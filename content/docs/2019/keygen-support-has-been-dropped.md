The support for the non-standard [`<keygen>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/keygen) HTML element and [`HTMLKeygenElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/HTMLKeygenElement) DOM interface has been removed with Firefox 69. This public key generator functionality was never implemented by Internet Explorer and Google Chrome has already removed the support with [version 57](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5716060992962560) shipped in March 2017. Use the standard [Web Crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API) and [Web Authentication API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Web_Authentication_API) instead.
