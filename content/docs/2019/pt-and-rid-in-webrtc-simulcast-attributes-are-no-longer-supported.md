Firefox 71 has stopped parsing the legacy `pt=` and `rid=` parameters in WebRTC simulcast attributes. The new format supported since Firefox 68 only requires a RID, so, for example,

```
a=simulcast: send rid=8 recv rid=9
```

has to be

```
a=simulcast: send 8 recv 9
```

Currently, video calls in *Google Hangouts Meet* and *Whereby* are broken due to this change.

**Update**: This change has been reverted in Firefox 71 to give services more time to adopt the new behaviour. Mozilla developers are planning to redo the change with Firefox 72.

**Update 2**: The change has been landed again to Firefox 72 after both *Google* and *Whereby* fixed their issue. If you run a similar service, please be sure to test it.
