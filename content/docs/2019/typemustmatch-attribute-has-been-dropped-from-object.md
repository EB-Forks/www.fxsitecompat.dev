The support for the `typemustmatch` attribute on the HTML `<object>` element and the corresponding [`typeMustMatch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/HTMLObjectElement/typeMustMatch) property on the `HTMLObjectElement` DOM interface has been removed from the latest HTML Living Standard and Firefox 68. No other browsers support the attribute, so the compatibility risk should be very low.
