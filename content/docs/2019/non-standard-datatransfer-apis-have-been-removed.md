The non-standard `mozGetDataAt`, `mozSetDataAt`, `mozClearDataAt` and `mozTypesAt` methods as well as the `mozItemCount` property on the [`DataTransfer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/DataTransfer) interface, deprecated since [Firefox 63](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2018/non-standard-datatransfer-apis-have-been-deprecated/), have been removed with Firefox 71. Use the standard `getData`, `setData` and `clearData` methods as well as the `items` property instead.
