      title: "Bug 792665 â€“ Separate HTMLMediaElement.src from HTMLMediaElement.srcObject"
---
Previously the value of the [`HTMLMediaElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement).`src` property was a media stream object. In the process of standardization, Mozilla has proposed that the `src` property represents a URL string of the media while the new `srcObject` property has the object. The Firefox implementation has been changed to reflect the proposal. For now, `srcObject` is prefixed `mozSrcObject`.

**Update**: The `mozSrcObject` property has been unprefixed with [Firefox 42](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2015/htmlmediaelement-srcobject-has-been-unprefixed/) and removed with [Firefox 58](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2017/htmlmediaelement-mozsrcobject-has-been-removed/).
