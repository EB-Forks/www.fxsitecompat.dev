---
The `mozallowfullscreen` attribute, that allows content in inline frames ([`<iframe>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe)) to be [fullscreen](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Guide/DOM/Using_full_screen_mode), has been unprefixed. The corresponding `mozAllowFullScreen` property on the `HTMLIFrameElement` DOM interface has also been changed to `allowfullscreen`. The HTML5 `allowfullscreen` attribute is actually used for *YouTube*'s embedded players.
