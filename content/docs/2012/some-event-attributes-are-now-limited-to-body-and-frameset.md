Previously, the [`onbeforeunload`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/window.onbeforeunload) attribute has been recognized even if it has been set on any elements, and the named handler is called when the event is fired. To comply with the spec, it's now ignored when it has been set on elements other than [`body`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/body) and [`<frameset>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/frameset). The other attributes treated the same include [`onafterprint`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/window.onafterprint), [`onbeforeprint`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/window.onbeforeprint), [`onhashchange`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/window.onhashchange), [`onoffline`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/window.onoffline), [`ononline`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/window.ononline), [`onpagehide`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/window.onpagehide), [`onpageshow`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/window.onpageshow), [`onpopstate`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/window.onpopstate), [`onresize`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/window.onresize) and [`onunload`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/window.onunload).
