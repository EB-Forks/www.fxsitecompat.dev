The [`document.implementation.hasFeature`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/document.implementation.hasFeature) and [`Node.isSupported`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Node.isSupported) methods have been changed to always return `true`. The spec has been changed because those APIs were considered useless. However the SVG features are exception; those methods continue to return the support statuses.

**Update**: The `isSupported` method has been removed with [Firefox 22](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2013/node-issupported-has-been-removed/).

**Update 2**: The SVG exception has been removed with [Firefox 51](https://www.fxsitecompat.dev/en-CA/docs/2016/hasfeature-will-always-return-true-even-for-svg/).
