      title: "Bug 789036 â€“ Mootools 1.2.x was broken by String.prototype.contains"
---
Firefox 18 adds the ECMAScript 6 function [`String.prototype.contains`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/contains). Unfortunately, old version of *Mootools* assume there is no such function, and fail to work when it exists. This problem is fixed in *Mootools* 1.3 and newer.
