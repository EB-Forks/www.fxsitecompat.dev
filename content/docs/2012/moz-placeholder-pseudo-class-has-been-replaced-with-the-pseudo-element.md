      title: "Bug 737786 â€“ Switch from :-moz-placeholder to ::-moz-placeholder (pseudo-class to pseudo-element)"
---
The [`:-moz-placeholder`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/:-moz-placeholder) pseudo-class that matches form elements with the [`placeholder`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Forms_in_HTML#The_placeholder_attribute) attribute has been removed, and the [`::-moz-placeholder`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/::-moz-placeholder) pseudo-element has been added instead. The implementation of WebKit has been a pseudo-element, and this change is a part of the standardization effort.
